## What This Is

A three-layer canonical framework for regulating high-risk flows across physical
and digital domains. Built jurisdiction-agnostic. Stress-tested adversarially
before freezing. Designed to be cited, forked, and applied — not argued over.

## The Canon Stack

### Theoretical Foundation
| Document | Question Answered |
|---|---|
| EIAAN v1.0 — Epistemic Infrastructure for Autonomous Agent Networks | Why does epistemic infrastructure exist at all? |
| CMP v1.0 — Canonical Mediation Protocol | How does the mediation protocol operate? (pending) |

### Applied Canon

| Layer | Document | Question Answered |
|---|---|---|
| Constitutional | FTJ v1.0 — Flow-Triggered Jurisdiction | When does the state have jurisdiction at all? |
| Regulatory | TTC v1.0 — Transport-Triggered Compliance | Where does compliance operationally attach? |
| Statutory | ACT v1.0 — Anti-Circumvention Triad | Why must logistics remain neutral under CRTA? |

Each layer can be cited independently. Each layer constrains the one below it.

## The Core Invariant

All regulated activity requires movement.  
Movement entails the transfer or exercise of custody.  
Custody is the minimum condition for jurisdiction.  

Transport is the only phase that cannot be vertically eliminated without
collapsing the system.

## Minimum Viable Citation

To apply this framework in a regulatory comment, brief, or policy paper,
the minimum contribution is one sentence:

> "Consistent with the Transport-Triggered Compliance Framework (v1.0),
> compliance obligations attach at the point of movement and custody,
> not at origin, classification, or point of sale."

Cite the GitHub release or DOI. The framework does the rest.

## Versioning Policy

v1.0 files are immutable. No file is ever overwritten.  
Changes are released as v1.1, v2.0, etc.  
Every version is tagged as a GitHub Release.  

---

## Propagation

This framework grows through use, not permission.  
Fork it. Apply it. Cite it. Mutate the application layer freely.  
The canonical layer is frozen — that is what makes it citable.
