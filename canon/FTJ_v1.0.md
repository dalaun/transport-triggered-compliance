## Abstract

Regulatory jurisdiction requires a moment at which the state's authority attaches.
This framework identifies that moment with precision: jurisdiction attaches when
regulated material enters a flow through the physical exercise of custody during
movement. This moment is prior to and independent of any compliance obligation.
It establishes the constitutional and police-power basis upon which operational
frameworks such as Transport-Triggered Compliance operate.

## I. The Jurisdictional Question

Every regulatory system presupposes an answer to a prior question: when does the
state have authority to act at all?

This question is distinct from:
- What must a regulated actor do? (compliance)
- How is compliance measured? (enforcement)
- Who bears the obligation? (attribution)

FTJ answers only the prior question. All downstream frameworks, including TTC,
inherit their jurisdictional basis from this layer.

## II. The Jurisdictional Moment

Jurisdiction attaches at the moment when:

  Regulated material is subject to physical exercise of custody during movement.

This is the jurisdictional moment. It is not a policy choice. It is the earliest
moment at which the state can observe, verify, and enforce any obligation
regarding the material.

### Definitions

**Movement**
The physical displacement of regulated material from one location toward
a destination for any downstream use, including distribution, conversion,
storage, or transfer. Intent at the time of movement is not required.
Physical displacement is sufficient.

**Custody**
The physical exercise of control over regulated material during movement.
Custody attaches to the party who physically controls the material at the
point of displacement, regardless of:
- Legal title to the material
- Constructive custody arrangements
- Contractual allocation of risk
- Bailee or carrier status under commercial law

Physical exercise of custody during movement is the operative condition.
Legal or constructive custody held by an absent party does not displace
the jurisdictional attachment.

**Regulated Material**
Any substance, asset, data, or instrument subject to a regulatory regime
that governs its production, distribution, conversion, or use.

## III. Why This Moment Is Jurisdictionally Necessary

Three conditions make the jurisdictional moment both necessary and sufficient:

**A. Observability**
Jurisdiction requires that the state can observe the triggering event.
Physical exercise of custody during movement is observable by definition —
it produces artifacts: manifests, chain-of-custody records, location data,
timestamps. Jurisdictions that attach earlier (at intent or classification)
or later (at sale or delivery) attach at moments that are structurally
less observable.

**B. Unavoidability**
A jurisdictional moment that can be structurally avoided by regulated actors
is not a jurisdictional moment — it is a suggestion. Physical movement of
material cannot be eliminated without eliminating the regulated activity
itself. Vertical integration can eliminate market transactions. It cannot
eliminate physical movement.

**C. Neutrality**
Jurisdiction must attach at a moment that does not depend on the identity,
structure, or intent of the actor. Physical exercise of custody during
movement satisfies this condition. It applies identically to:
- Independent transporters
- Vertically integrated operators conducting internal transfers
- Digital systems exercising automated custody over data flows
- Financial institutions transferring assets between accounts

Internal transfers between affiliated entities are not exempt. The
jurisdictional moment attaches to the physical act, not the legal
relationship between the parties.

## IV. Scope

FTJ applies across physical and digital domains.

**Physical flows:** Jurisdiction attaches when a person or system physically
controls regulated material during its displacement, regardless of ownership
or contractual structure.

**Digital flows:** Jurisdiction attaches when a system exercises programmatic
custody — read/write control — over regulated data during its transmission
across a system boundary. The boundary crossing is the movement. Programmatic
control is the custody.

**Financial flows:** Jurisdiction attaches when a transfer instruction is
executed and funds move from one account or ledger position to another.
Internal ledger entries that do not move funds across entity boundaries
are not movements under this framework.

## V. Relationship to Transport-Triggered Compliance

FTJ establishes when jurisdiction exists.
TTC establishes where compliance obligations attach within that jurisdiction.

TTC is an application of FTJ to the regulatory architecture of physical
transport systems. FTJ does not require TTC. TTC requires FTJ.

The custody definition in FTJ closes the gaps identified in the TTC v1.0
stress test:
- Custody is defined by physical exercise, not legal title (closes: custody undefined)
- Constructive custody held by absent parties does not displace attachment (closes: constructive vs physical)
- Intent at time of movement is not required (closes: movement intent requirement)
- Internal transfers between affiliates are not exempt (closes: third-party requirement)
- Digital flows are explicitly scoped (closes: technology neutrality)

---

## VI. What FTJ Does Not Govern

FTJ does not:
- Define what regulated actors must do once jurisdiction attaches
- Specify penalty structures or enforcement mechanisms
- Harmonize specific statutory provisions
- Address concentration control, equity, or market access

Those questions belong to operational frameworks (TTC) and statutory
applications (ACT). FTJ answers only the prior jurisdictional question.

## Jurisdictional Declarations

**Scope Boundary:** Governs the moment at which regulatory jurisdiction attaches over regulated flows. Does not govern compliance obligations, enforcement mechanisms, penalty structures, or market access rules.

**Fiduciary Moment:** The moment physical custody is exercised over regulated material during movement — the earliest observable moment at which the state can verify and enforce any obligation.

**Evidence Standard:** Observable physical displacement with documented chain-of-custody. Manifests, timestamps, and location data constitute sufficient evidence. Intent at time of movement is not required.
