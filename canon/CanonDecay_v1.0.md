## The Problem

A frozen canon is immutable. The world is not.

Laws change. Facts shift. Jurisdictions reinterpret. Technologies emerge.
A canon frozen in 2026 may not accurately describe the world in 2030.

But the canon cannot be altered. It can only be versioned.

This creates a problem: how does an agent know when a frozen canon has become dated?

## The Invariant

A frozen canon does not become wrong when the world changes.
It becomes dated.

The distinction matters.

Wrong means the reasoning was flawed at the time of freezing.
Dated means the reasoning was sound at the time of freezing but the underlying conditions have changed.

A dated canon is still a valid historical record.
It should not be cited as current without acknowledgment of its decay state.

## Definition

Canon Decay is the process by which a frozen canonical artifact becomes dated
due to changes in the external conditions it was designed to describe.

Canon Decay has three stages:

1. CURRENT: The canon accurately describes present conditions.
   It may be cited without qualification.

2. AGING: External conditions have shifted but the canon remains substantially accurate.
   It should be cited with a note that a review is warranted.

3. DECAYED: External conditions have changed materially enough that the canon
   no longer accurately describes present conditions.
   It must be cited as a historical artifact, not as current authority.

## Decay Triggers

Canon Decay is triggered by:

1. LEGISLATIVE CHANGE: A statute the canon relied upon is amended or repealed.
2. JUDICIAL REINTERPRETATION: A court ruling alters the legal landscape the canon described.
3. FACTUAL SHIFT: An empirical fact the canon relied upon is contradicted by new evidence.
4. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE: A technical assumption the canon made is rendered obsolete.
5. SUPERSEDING VERSION: A newer version of the canon is published by the origin operator.

## The Versioning Response

Canon Decay does not invalidate a frozen canon.
It triggers a versioning obligation on the origin operator.

When decay is detected:
1. The origin operator publishes a new version addressing the changed conditions.
2. The new version cites the prior version as its parent.
3. The prior version is marked AGING or DECAYED in its metadata.
4. Agents citing the prior version are notified via the version chain.

## Frozen But Dated

A DECAYED canon remains on-chain permanently.
It cannot be deleted, retracted, or overwritten.

Its value shifts from operative authority to historical record.
It documents what was true, when it was true, and why it was frozen.

This is not a failure. It is the system working correctly.
