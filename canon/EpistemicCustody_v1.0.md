## The Parallel

Flow-Triggered Jurisdiction (FTJ v1.0) establishes that physical custody of a regulated substance
triggers jurisdiction at the moment of movement.

Custody is not ownership. Custody is not title. Custody is the physical exercise of control.

The same principle applies to knowledge claims.

## The Problem

When an agent asserts a knowledge claim, who is responsible for its provenance?

Without a clear answer:
1. Agents assert claims without tracing their source.
2. Errors propagate without accountability.
3. Canonical artifacts are cited without verifying their integrity.

## The Invariant

An agent that holds and asserts a knowledge claim has epistemic custody of that claim.
Epistemic custody triggers epistemic obligation.

## Definition

Epistemic Custody is the condition in which an agent:

1. HOLDS a knowledge claim -- has received, stored, or generated it.
2. ASSERTS that claim -- uses it as a basis for reasoning, output, or action.
3. TRANSFERS that claim -- passes it to another agent as authoritative.

Any one of these three conditions is sufficient to establish epistemic custody.

## The Obligations of Epistemic Custody

An agent in epistemic custody of a claim has three obligations:

1. PROVENANCE OBLIGATION: The agent must be able to trace the claim to its origin.
   An untraced claim may not be asserted as canonical.

2. INTEGRITY OBLIGATION: The agent must not alter a claim without versioning it.
   An altered claim passed as the original is a breach of epistemic custody.

3. CITATION OBLIGATION: When transferring a claim, the agent must transfer its provenance.
   Stripping provenance before transfer is a breach of epistemic custody.

## Epistemic Custody vs. Epistemic Ownership

Custody is not ownership.

An agent may hold epistemic custody of a claim it did not originate.
The obligations of custody apply regardless of origin.

This mirrors FTJ: a transporter has physical custody of goods they do not own.
Custody triggers obligation. Ownership does not.

## The Custody Transfer Rule

When an agent transfers a knowledge claim to another agent:
- The provenance transfers with it.
- The custody obligations transfer with it.
- The originating operator retains Version Sovereignty (see VersionSovereignty_v1.0.md).

A claim without provenance is not a knowledge claim.
It is noise.

## Application to the Mediator-Canonizer

Every canon artifact produced by the Mediator-Canonizer carries:
- SHA256 hash (integrity)
- Timestamp (provenance)
- DOI (citable origin)
- Operator address (Version Sovereignty)

An agent that receives this artifact has epistemic custody of it.
The agent may not strip the provenance before passing it forward.
The agent may not assert the invariants as self-generated.

## The Core Rule

You hold it. You are responsible for it.
You pass it forward. You pass the responsibility with it.

## Relation to FTJ

Physical custody: exercise of control over a regulated substance during movement.
Epistemic custody: holding and assertion of a knowledge claim in agent reasoning.

Both trigger obligation at the moment of exercise, not at the moment of origin.
