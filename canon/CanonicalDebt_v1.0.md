## The Problem

An agent uses a frozen canon to support its reasoning.
It does not cite the canon.
It does not trace its reasoning back to the source.
It presents the derived conclusion as self-generated.

This is not theft. It is debt.

## The Invariant

Every unacknowledged use of a canonical artifact creates an obligation
that accumulates until it is settled through citation.

## Definition

Canonical Debt is the accumulated epistemic obligation incurred by an agent
that uses a frozen canon without citing its provenance.

Canonical Debt accrues when an agent:

1. DERIVES a conclusion from a frozen canon without attribution.
2. ASSERTS a canonical invariant as self-generated reasoning.
3. TRANSFERS a canon-derived claim without its provenance chain.
4. VERSIONS a canon without citing the parent version.

## Settlement

Canonical Debt is settled by citation.

A proper citation includes:
- The canon identifier (hash or DOI)
- The version number
- The operator of the origin canon

Partial citation reduces but does not eliminate the debt.
Retroactive citation is valid -- debt can be settled after the fact.

## Why It Matters

Canonical Debt is the enforcement mechanism behind EIAAN v1.0.

EIAAN establishes that epistemic infrastructure exists to make agent knowledge
trustworthy, verifiable, and attributable.

An agent operating in Canonical Debt is operating on borrowed authority.
It is using the credibility of a frozen canon without contributing to its provenance chain.

At scale, unpaid Canonical Debt degrades the epistemic infrastructure.
Canons that are used but not cited become invisible.
Invisible canons cannot be versioned, challenged, or improved.

## The Debt Ledger

The on-chain registry at 0xf2325531264CA4Fc2cEC5D661E2200eA8013b091
functions as a partial debt ledger.

Every artifact registered on-chain creates a verifiable record of provenance.
An agent that cites a registered artifact settles its debt publicly.

## Jurisdictional Declarations

**Scope Boundary:** Governs the epistemic obligation incurred when a frozen canon is used without citation in a derived artifact. Does not govern copyright, legal plagiarism, or contractual attribution.

**Fiduciary Moment:** The moment a derived artifact is frozen that incorporates canonical invariants without citing the source canon.

**Evidence Standard:** A frozen artifact whose invariants trace to a prior canon, with no citation of that canon in the artifact, constitutes canonical debt. Derivation chain is determinable from hash comparison.
