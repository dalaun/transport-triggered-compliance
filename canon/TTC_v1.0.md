## Abstract

Regulatory regimes commonly attach compliance obligations at points of production
or sale. This approach fails where regulated material is vertically integrated,
internally transferred, or structurally shielded from market access. This paper
articulates a general framework — Transport-Triggered Compliance — in which legal
compliance attaches at the point where regulated material enters a controlled flow
through movement and custody. At this point, jurisdiction, accountability, and
auditability necessarily converge. The framework is jurisdiction-agnostic and
technology-neutral, and it applies across physical and digital domains to provide
a structurally neutral mechanism for enforcement, concentration control, and equity.

## I. The Problem Class: Regulating Flows, Not Objects

Modern regulatory failures share a common trait: they attempt to regulate objects
— products, licenses, or entities — rather than flows.

Where upstream and downstream actors are vertically integrated, object-based
regulation produces recurring pathologies:
- Internal transfers evade market participation.
- Concentration limits become unenforceable in practice.
- Equity mechanisms exist on paper but not in operation.

These failures persist regardless of statutory intent because enforcement attaches
at points that regulated actors can structurally avoid.

---

## II. The Invariant Constraint

Across all regulated systems — physical or digital — the following invariant holds:

- All regulated activity requires movement.
- Movement entails the transfer or exercise of custody.
- Custody is the minimum condition for jurisdiction.

Transport is the only phase that:
- Cannot be vertically eliminated without collapsing the system;
- Necessarily involves third-party accountability; and
- Produces auditable records across otherwise siloed actors.

Any regulatory framework that ignores this constraint will fail at scale.

## III. The Transport-Triggered Compliance Rule

### Definition

Transport-Triggered Compliance is a regulatory architecture in which legal
jurisdiction and compliance obligations attach at the point where regulated
material enters a controlled flow through movement and custody, rather than
at origin, classification, or point of sale.

### General Rule

Compliance is triggered when:
- Material is moved for distribution, conversion, or downstream use; and
- Custody is transferred or exercised during that movement.

This rule is jurisdiction-agnostic and technology-neutral.

## IV. Why Transport Is the Optimal Enforcement Layer

### A. Unavoidability
Production can fragment. Retail can consolidate. Transport cannot disappear
without collapsing the system.

### B. Neutrality
Transport regulation does not depend on defining product characteristics,
intent, or end use. It regulates movement and custody, not meaning.

### C. Auditability
Transport necessarily generates manifests, custody records, timestamps, and
chain-of-control artifacts that enable automated and retrospective oversight.

### D. Equity by Structure
When compliance attaches at transport:
- Internal self-sourcing becomes visible.
- Concentration limits become calculable.
- Market access no longer depends on discretionary gatekeeping.

Equity emerges as a structural consequence, not a discretionary policy choice.

---

## V. Concentration Control Through Transport Metrics

Transport-Triggered Compliance enables automated concentration enforcement
by tracking:
- Total inbound or outbound flow;
- Flow share attributable to each transport actor; and
- Threshold alerts and corrective obligations.

Because all regulated flows pass through transport, concentration metrics
become enforceable without intrusive or actor-specific oversight.

## VI. Cross-Domain Applicability

### A. Intoxicants and Controlled Substances
Risk does not emerge at cultivation or origin, but when material enters an
ingestible, distributable, or convertible flow.

### B. Data Governance
Data is inert at rest. Risk attaches when data moves across systems,
interfaces, or jurisdictions.

### C. Financial Assets
Funds become regulated when transferred, not when held internally.

Across domains, movement coupled with custody is the moment of regulation.

## VII. Institutional Advantages

Institutions adopting Transport-Triggered Compliance gain:
- Reduced enforcement surface area;
- Lower definitional and classification disputes;
- Automated compliance monitoring; and
- Neutral application across market participants.

Most importantly, the framework enables enforcement of legislative intent
without expanding statutory scope or relying on discretionary intervention.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

Regulatory systems fail when they attempt to control actors rather than flows.
Transport-Triggered Compliance aligns enforcement with unavoidable physical and
informational realities. By attaching compliance at the point of movement and
custody, regulators achieve durability, neutrality, and structural equity while
minimizing administrative complexity.

### Reclassification of Applied Submissions

Once this framework exists, jurisdiction-specific filings are properly
characterized as:

"Application of the Transport-Triggered Compliance Framework (v1.0) to
[Specific Regulatory Context]."

The substance of those submissions does not change. Their status does.

This is the shift from advocacy to application — from participant to author.
