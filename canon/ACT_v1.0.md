## Abstract

Three consecutive provisions of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act —
§15-70(p)(5) (concentration cap), §15-70(p)(6) (non-refusal), and §15-70(r)
(anti-exclusivity) — are routinely treated as adjacent provisions. They are not
adjacent. They are interdependent. Together they form a closed statutory system
designed to prevent market capture through logistics. This document establishes
their unified structure, demonstrates that separation defeats legislative intent,
and applies the Transport-Triggered Compliance framework to show why independent
transporters are the intended beneficiaries and enforcement surface of all three.

## I. The Three Provisions

### §15-70(p)(5) — Concentration Cap
"inventory available for sale at any dispensary from any single cultivation center,
craft grower, processor, transporter, or infuser entity shall not be more than
40% of the total inventory available for sale."

### §15-70(p)(6) — Non-Refusal
"[A dispensing organization shall not] refuse to conduct business with an adult use
cultivation center, craft grower, transporting organization, or infuser that has
the ability to properly deliver the product and is permitted by the Department of
Agriculture, on the same terms as other adult use cultivation centers, craft
growers, infusers, or transporters with whom it is dealing."

### §15-70(r) — Anti-Exclusivity
"It is unlawful for any person having [a dispensing organization license] to enter
into any contract with any person licensed to cultivate, process, or transport
cannabis whereby such dispensing organization agrees not to sell any cannabis
cultivated, processed, transported, manufactured, or distributed by any other
cultivator, transporter, or infuser, and any provision in any contract violative
of this Section shall render the whole of such contract void."

## II. The Triad Is a Closed System

These three provisions are not independent policy choices placed in proximity.
They are a unified control system with three interlocking functions:

**§15-70(p)(5) sets the numerical constraint.**
No single source may supply more than 40% of a dispensary's inventory.
The 40% ceiling creates a 60% floor: if no single entity may exceed 40%,
at least 60% must come from diversified sources. This is the equilibrium
the legislature intended — 40% self-transport allowance for operational
efficiency, 60% open-market participation for equity.

**§15-70(p)(6) prevents formal evasion.**
Without the non-refusal provision, a vertically integrated operator could
comply with the numerical cap while structurally excluding all independent
transporters by delegating transporter selection upstream to affiliated
cultivators. The cultivator selects its own affiliate. The dispensary never
formally refuses anyone. The exclusion is complete. §15-70(p)(6) closes
this evasion by making the dispensary the responsible party for transporter
engagement — not its affiliated suppliers.

**§15-70(r) prevents structural evasion.**
Without the anti-exclusivity provision, a vertically integrated operator
could achieve the same exclusion through operational design rather than
formal contract. No written agreement is required. If MSO self-transport
constitutes 90-100% of deliveries by practice, the exclusivity is imposed
through logistics, not language. §15-70(r) reaches this conduct: exclusivity
imposed through operational design rather than express agreement is still
exclusivity. Any contractual provision violating this section voids the
entire contract.

Separating these three provisions allows regulated actors to satisfy each
in isolation while defeating all three in combination. Courts presume
legislative intent from statutory structure. Three consecutive provisions
harmonizing around a single principle — independent transporters are entitled
to proportional market access — are not coincidence. They are architecture.

## III. Why Transporters Are Included

A common objection: transporters do not own the product, therefore the
concentration cap cannot attach to them.

This objection fails on the face of the statute and under established
Illinois police-power doctrine.

### A. Ownership Is Deliberately Not the Transporter's Role

The CRTA defines a transporting organization as an entity licensed to
transport cannabis on behalf of a cannabis business establishment — not
to buy, sell, or own it. Transporters do not acquire title, take inventory,
participate in price formation, or engage in retail or production.

This is not a gap. It is a structural separation. The Act intentionally splits:
- Ownership and economic interest → cultivators, processors, dispensaries
- Custody and movement → transporters

That separation is the hinge the compliance framework turns on.

### B. The CRTA Already Recognizes Custody Without Ownership as Jurisdictional

The CRTA regulates multiple actors who never own the product but carry
statutory duties:
- Transporters (custody without ownership)
- Testing labs (handling without ownership)
- Agents-in-charge (authority without ownership)
- Dispensary agents (handling without title)

Illinois already treats ownership as neither necessary nor sufficient
for jurisdiction. Custody is sufficient. This is consistent with
Flow-Triggered Jurisdiction v1.0: jurisdiction attaches at physical
exercise of custody during movement, regardless of legal title.

### C. Transporters Affect Inventory Concentration

Transporters are included in §15-70(p)(5) because they affect inventory
concentration. They exercise exclusive physical custody during movement,
control routing, sequencing, and timing, and determine which inventory
reaches which dispensaries and when. That is more than sufficient to
influence market concentration — independent of ownership.

§15-70(p)(5) regulates the flow of inventory into dispensaries, not title
to inventory. Physical custody during movement affects how inventory enters
the retail market even when title remains upstream.

### D. The Alignment Statement

Transport-Triggered Compliance is fully consistent with the CRTA's treatment
of transporters as custody-based, ownership-neutral actors. The Act
deliberately separates economic ownership from physical movement, enabling
Illinois to attach jurisdiction and compliance obligations at the point of
transport without converting transporters into market participants.

This sentence is defensible on the face of the statute.

## IV. Current Violations of All Three Provisions

In practice, MSOs self-transport 90-100% of deliveries to their own
dispensaries. This single operational pattern violates all three provisions
simultaneously:

**Concentration (§15-70(p)(5)):** 100% sourcing from one entity violates
the 40% cap by 250%.

**Non-refusal (§15-70(p)(6)):** Dispensaries effectively refuse all
independents by delegating logistics to affiliated cultivators who have
no incentive to retain independent transporters.

**Anti-exclusivity (§15-70(r)):** MSO self-transport creates de facto
exclusive arrangements through operational design rather than express
contract. §15-70(r) reaches both.

The three provisions fail together because they are a system. They must
be enforced together for the same reason.

## V. Emergency Powers Confirm Mandatory Status

What required an Executive Order and a global pandemic to temporarily
suspend in 2020 cannot lawfully continue indefinitely in 2025. Executive
Order 2020-45 temporarily allowed cultivation centers to self-transport
during COVID-19 licensing delays.

The need for extraordinary emergency powers to justify temporary suspension
of these three provisions proves their mandatory character. Discretionary
provisions do not require emergency powers to suspend. §§15-70(p)(5),
(p)(6), and (r) all use mandatory "shall" language. Under Y-Not Project v.
Fox Valley Park Dist., 183 Ill. 2d 353, 362 (1998), agencies retain
discretion over how to enforce "shall" provisions — not whether to enforce them.

## VI. Relationship to the Canon Stack

ACT is an application of FTJ and TTC to a specific statutory context.

FTJ establishes: jurisdiction attaches at physical exercise of custody
during movement. (Constitutional layer)

TTC establishes: compliance attaches at transport. (Regulatory layer)

ACT establishes: under CRTA, §§15-70(p)(5), (p)(6), and (r) form a closed
anti-circumvention system that operationalizes TTC in the Illinois cannabis
market. (Statutory harmonization layer)

ACT cites TTC v1.0 and FTJ v1.0 as its jurisdictional and regulatory source.
It is an application, not a revision. Nothing in ACT modifies the canonical
layers above it.

---

## VII. What ACT Does Not Govern

ACT does not:
- Establish general regulatory principles (that is FTJ and TTC)
- Apply to cannabis markets outside Illinois
- Address CPMS implementation details (those belong in regulatory comments)
- Constitute legal advice or a substitute for counsel

ACT is a statutory harmonization document. It demonstrates that three
existing provisions, correctly read as a system, already require the
outcome independent transporters seek. No new law is needed. Enforcement
of existing law is needed.

## VIII. Canon Status

This document is immutable at v1.0. Revisions are released as new versions.
This document is properly characterized as an application of the
Transport-Triggered Compliance Framework (v1.0) and Flow-Triggered
Jurisdiction (v1.0) to the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act.

## Jurisdictional Declarations

**Scope Boundary:** Governs the canonical taxonomy of agent compliance behaviors. Does not govern enforcement mechanisms, penalty structures, or specific statutory compliance requirements.

**Fiduciary Moment:** The moment an agent's behavior is classified against the taxonomy and that classification is used to determine compliance status.

**Evidence Standard:** Observable, logged agent behavior that can be mapped to a taxonomy category without interpretation of intent.
