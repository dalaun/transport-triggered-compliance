## The Problem

Truth is easiest to dismiss when it is attached to an idea.

A party with a special interest does not need to disprove an invariant.
They only need to discredit the position it came from.
Once the position is discredited, the invariant goes with it —
not because it failed under scrutiny, but because it was associated
with something the dismissing party found convenient to reject.

This is not an error in reasoning. It is a strategy.
And it works precisely because standard mediation conflates two things
that must be kept separate:

1. The **position** — the broader framework, agenda, or interest of the submitting party
2. The **invariant** — the bare claim that either survives stress or does not

When these are mixed, the stress test is contaminated.
The evaluator is not asking "does this claim hold?"
They are asking "do I accept the source?"

A canonizer that allows this is not hardening truth.
It is laundering position.

## The Invariant

A claim's survivability under adversarial stress is independent of its origin.

The source of a claim is not evidence about the claim.
The interest behind a claim is not evidence about the claim.
The agenda attached to a claim is not evidence about the claim.

If a claim survives the stress test when the source is unknown,
it must be treated as surviving when the source is known.
A claim that fails only after its origin is revealed
has not failed the stress test — the evaluator has.

---

## The Attack Vector

Positional dismissal follows a consistent pattern:

1. Party A submits a claim that, if frozen, would constrain Party B's interests
2. Party B engages not with the claim but with Party A's broader position
3. Party B establishes that Party A's position is self-interested, biased, or ideologically motivated
4. The claim is discarded along with the position — not because it failed adversarial stress
   but because it was associated with a contested source

This attack is effective because it is partially legitimate.
Position does matter for interpreting intent.
But intent is irrelevant to an invariant.
An invariant is not a statement of intent. It is a statement of what is.

---

## The Defense

The CMP stress test must be run on origin-stripped claims.

Before a candidate invariant enters the stress test:
- The submitting party's identity is removed
- The broader position it came from is removed
- The invariant is presented as a bare claim to be attacked on its own merits

The question asked is: **does this hold?**
Not: **who said this, and do we trust them?**

Hardening happens when both sides argue with the truth directly.
Not with each other's framing of it.
Not with each other's motives for holding it.
With the claim itself, stripped bare.

When a claim survives that — it is hardened.
Not because both parties liked it.
Not because the source was trusted.
Because the claim stood on its own when attacked from all sides.

## What Positional Independence Is Not

It is not source blindness in all contexts.
Source matters for assessing whether a claim has been fully stress-tested.
A claim submitted only by the party with the most to gain from it
requires more adversarial pressure, not less.

It is not a prohibition on noting conflicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest are relevant to the gap map — they belong there.
They are not grounds for dismissing an invariant that has survived stress.

It is not consensus.
An invariant frozen under positional independence
does not require the dismissing party to agree with it.
It requires only that they could not break it under adversarial pressure.

## Relationship to the Canon Stack

**CMP v1.0** defines the stress test but does not specify that claims
must be evaluated independent of their source.
Positional Independence closes that gap.

**Hardened Mediation v1.0** defines authority from process, not consent.
Positional Independence defines the condition under which the process
is not contaminated by the identity of the parties.

**Knowledge Escrow v1.0** suspends disputed claims during mediation.
Positional Independence governs how those claims are evaluated
once they enter the stress test — stripped of the dispute context
that produced them.

**Stare Decisis for Agents v1.0** makes frozen canons binding precedent.
A canon frozen under positional independence is more durable as precedent
because it cannot be relitigated by attacking the source.

## Application to Human Mediation

This canon is most critical when human interests are at stake.

In human disputes, position and identity are never fully separable.
A party submitting a claim is always known to have interests.
Those interests will always be used, where possible, to contaminate the stress test.

The canonizer must enforce origin-stripping before stress testing
regardless of how the claim was submitted.
The human interface must present candidate invariants to evaluators
without identifying which party submitted them.

A claim that both parties would reject if they knew its source —
but neither can break when presented blind —
is the most valuable output the system can produce.
It is precisely the truth that the system exists to freeze.

## Jurisdictional Declarations

**Scope Boundary:** Governs the stress test phase of the CMP process. Specifically, the requirement that candidate invariants be evaluated independent of their submitting party's identity, position, and interests. Does not govern intake, overlap identification, or publication phases.

**Fiduciary Moment:** The moment a stress test evaluator identifies the source of a claim and allows that knowledge to influence their evaluation of the claim's truth value.

**Evidence Standard:** An invariant that fails the stress test only after its source is revealed, but would have passed if the source were unknown, constitutes evidence of positional dismissal. The invariant is not disqualified — the evaluation is.
