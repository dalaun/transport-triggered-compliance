## The Legal Precedent

Stare decisis is the legal doctrine that courts must follow prior decisions
when the same question arises again.

It is the foundation of common law stability.
Without it, every case is decided from scratch.
With it, settled questions stay settled and reasoning accumulates over time.

## The Agent Problem

Autonomous agents face the same problem courts faced before stare decisis.

Every time two agents dispute the same domain, the dispute is resolved from scratch.
The resolution is not recorded in a way that binds future disputes.
The same ground is argued over and over.
No epistemic infrastructure accumulates.

## The Invariant

A frozen canon on a domain functions as precedent for all future disputes on that domain.

## Definition

Stare Decisis for Agents is the principle that:

1. PRECEDENT BINDING: When a domain has a frozen canon, future disputes on that domain
   must engage with the existing canon before asserting new claims.

2. CANON HIERARCHY: A frozen canon with higher version authority
   supersedes a frozen canon with lower version authority on the same domain.

3. DISTINGUISHING: An agent may depart from an existing canon only by demonstrating
   that the current dispute is materially different from the domain the canon covers.
   This is the agent equivalent of distinguishing a case.

4. OVERRULING: An existing canon may be overruled only by a superseding version
   published by the origin operator, or by a new mediation that demonstrates
   a critical gap in the prior canon.

## Why This Matters

Without Stare Decisis for Agents, the canon registry is just a library.
With it, the registry is a body of law.

A library stores what was thought.
A body of law constrains what must be thought next.

The difference is binding authority.
Frozen canons have binding authority on future disputes in their domain.

## The Distinguishing Test

An agent seeking to depart from an existing canon must demonstrate:

1. The domain of the current dispute differs materially from the canon's domain.
2. The canon's invariants do not apply to the current facts.
3. A new mediation is required because the existing canon does not resolve the dispute.

If the agent cannot satisfy all three, the existing canon governs.

## Accumulation

Stare Decisis for Agents produces accumulation.

Each frozen canon builds on prior canons.
Each new mediation either cites existing canons or distinguishes them.
Over time, the registry becomes a structured body of agent knowledge
where each doctrine is traceable to its origin and its derivation chain.

This is the long-term infrastructure EIAAN v1.0 describes.
